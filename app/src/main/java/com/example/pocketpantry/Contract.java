/**********************************************************************
CONTRACT Interface
 This program uses Model View Presenter (MVP) architecture. The purpose
 of this interface is to establish how communication will occur between
 Views-Presenter as well as Presenter-Models.

 This interface contains all the abstract methods of the program. These
 methods will be implemented by the Models, Views, and Presenter
 classes.

 Models:
 DatabaseHelper

 Views:
 MainActivity, PantryView, PantryAddView, and PantryRecyclerView

 Presenter:
 Presenter

 To Do:
 1. The Views need to be refactored and the View interface needs to be
 built out with abstract functions.
 2. Functions in the Presenter interface pertaining to recipes are
 stubs.
 4. Views for Recipes need to be created
 5. DatabaseHelper's functions need to be refactored to perform
 database operations for pantry items as well as recipe items
